This page is mainly intended as a publicly accessible notebook of mine.
If the stuff which will be accumulated here is useful for anyone else I'm happy.

The page is powered by Hugo which is the **worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites**. It is written in Go.

It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/russross/blackfriday
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper
