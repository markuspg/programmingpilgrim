As about every two years I upgraded my mother's computer to the newest Debian release.
This time from _Stretch_ to _Buster_ (thanks to the Debian community for this great release again!).

For years I bought _HP_ printers because they worked really nice with Linux.
Last I bought a _HP LaserJet P1606dn_.
This one harmed the Linux happiness.
It needs some binary plugin and this regularly is a pain to install.

The upgrade broke the previously working installed printer.
So I set off to install it again.
I tried installing the plugin again and again with `hp-plugin` and `hp-setup`.
Both tools again and again told me the plugin was successfully installed but on the next call they requested installation again.

After some googling I found [this post](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/hplip-keeps-looping-at-plug-in-installation-4175647505/) on [linuxquestions.org](https://www.linuxquestions.org).
I tried running `hp-setup` with the `-g` flag and also found some files missing.
After running these commands everything worked fine:

    ln -s /usr/lib/sane /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/sane
    mkdir /usr/lib64/x86_64-linux-gnu
    ln -s /usr/lib64/sane /usr/lib64/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane

Thanks to _zaskar\_84_!
