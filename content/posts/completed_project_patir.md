Recently I resolved to (try to) abstain from starting new programming projects before having finished the current ones.

The first fruit of this resolution is a refactoring of [patir](https://github.com/damphyr/patir), a Ruby gem I use for a project at work. My contributions mostly come down to:

* extending the coverage of its unit tests
* increasing its documentation's coverage to 100%
* introducing [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org) to the project and realizing a common style and adherence to best practises
* updating the gem's dependencies to their current versions
