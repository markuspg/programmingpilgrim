Recently I had the special joy of visiting one of my favourite museums again after I guess about 15 years - the [Technik Museum Speyer](https://speyer.technik-museum.de/en/). For me as a computer guy it's a welcome diversion to see and study something physical instead of just immaterial thoughts and ideas.

With this post I want to give a concise overview of the hightlights of the vast and varied collection of the museum.

The visitor is welcomed by a huge hall stuffed with cars, airplanes, train engines, fire engines and even a carousel. Without impatient children I guess I could get lost for a few hours just there.

Fire engines are available from really early ones ...

... up to more recent ones like this huge one from Frankfurt Airport (next to a [DUKW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUKW)).

Next there is a huge outside area with a plentiful collection of airplanes, boats and various heavy machinery.

One highlight is the [submarine U9](https://speyer.technik-museum.de/en/submarine-u9) which can be looked at from inside too.

An impressive [Antonov 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-22) (the world's largest turboprop-powered airplane) is situated between the submarine and the next highlight, ...

... a [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747)! It can be entered over multiple platforms and there exists a long (although slow) slide down from the middle platform. It's even possible to walk on the wing which is a great experience.

Another view of the beauty from the bridge of an exhibited rescue ship:

A further big hall contains a few cars, plenty of motor cycles and a space flight exhibition with a moonlanding display and a [Buran spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buran_(spacecraft)).

Particular dear to my fancy for old Opels is an [Opel Ascona A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel_Ascona) on display which was driven by the famous German rally driver [Walter Röhrl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_R%C3%B6hrl).

Around the borders of the museum compound there are various heavy machinery and trains.

Unfortunately in the outside area some of the exhibits are in a sad state, but I guess with such a huge collection it's just not feasible to keep every exhibit in shape. Still it's better to be able to see them rather than having them scrapped. For little children there are plenty of diversions (rides) - although basically all of them cost € 1,-. I spent the equivalent of a grown-up's entrance fee on each of the children most probably - but to support such a great collection I do it without regret. There is a restaurant with reasonable food for reasonable prices (about € 13,- for a Schnitzel with French fries) in the museum.

My only real criticism would be that the explanations of the individual exhibits are quite scant. It would be great if there were the current texts as short introduction and maybe next in smaller font or via an app or QR code further information available.

But apart of this little criticism I can whole-heartedly recommend a day-trip to this great museum (about 90 minutes South of Frankfurt am Main).
