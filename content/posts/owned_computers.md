Recently I wondered how many computers I had owned and used already. By gut feeling it didn't seem like that many, but thinking about it it became a rather big number.

The first computer in my parents' house was an _AMD K6-2_ or _AMD K6-III_. I only remember it to be an _"AMD K6"_ and having 450 Mhz. It had some GeForce graphics card, 256 MB of SDRAM and a 10 GB hard drive. It was a huge disappointment because my only game at that time (_Need for Speed: High Stakes_) wouldn't run long until freezing the entire system.

The next system had an AMD processor again, this time with 700 Mhz and a _Slot A_ interface. RAM was only half with 128 MB, the hard drive doubled to 20 GB and it had a _3dfx Voodoo3_ graphics card. This setup happily ran _Need for Speed: High Stakes_ and later on _Age of Empires II_ but failed on _Battlefield 1942_. So at some point the _Voodoo3_ was replaced by a _GeForce Ti4200_ with 64 MB of video memory. I remember the feeling of pride and achievement buying this with hard saved about € 200,-. Both computers ran either _Windows 98_ or _Windows ME_, depending on the time.

_Battlefield 1942_ and some open-world 3D titles ran on the 700 Mhz PC, but especially the latter ones ran kind of in "stop motion mode", so at some point it gave way to an _ALDI PC_. _ALDI_ is a German retailer and around that time there was a bit of a craze about their occasionally offered computers. I remember an uncle of mine lining up in the morning to get one for me.

This computer felt like a quantum leap. Again there was a trusty _GeForce 4 Ti4200_ installed. This card generally has a dear place in my memory. Furthermore this was my first computer with _Windows XP_.

Next followed a computer with an _AMD Athlon 64 3500+_ CPU and an [Acer Aspire 5022WLMi](https://www.notebookcheck.com/Acer-Aspire-5022WLMi.343.0.html). The Acer being my first computer with an AMD (namely _X700_) graphics card. The main impression they left is being hot and loud. The Acer laptop had really bad battery life too and after about a year the battery was dead anyhow. The _AMD 3500+_ computer had a _GeForce 6600 GT_ graphics card. At some point its fan died, so instead I attached a case fan to it and it kept working like that without issues.

Having created maps before around this time (I guess it must have been somewhere around 2005) I got into 3D modeling and _Blender_. For some reason I thought _Blender_ was Linux-only and so this paved my way into Linux - which should prove to be kind of life altering. I remember going to the tiny computer store in my home town and trying it on some computer there and subsequently buying a big box with a huge handbook of _SUSE Linux 9.2_. This finally put the 64 bit CPUs of my computers to use (I never owned a 64 bit Windows - _Windows XP_ being my last).

From _SUSE_ my path led to _Gentoo Linux_ - hours and hours of compiling kernels and Firefox. And always the excitement if the self-written _GRUB_ and _X.Org_ configurations would work. But still this time felt great, learning tons of new things and every new release of whatever bringing great new features and long-desired codec or hardware support. I still like Linux a lot, but now that everything has matured the excitement has worn off.

When going to university I bought a used [Fujitsu-Siemens Lifebook E8110](https://www.notebookcheck.com/Fujitsu-Siemens-Lifebook-E8110.781.0.html) laptop, which was a great investment. For a few years I bought and recommended _Fujitsu-Siemens_ computers and they never let me or others down. It's a pity they stopped making computers and laptops. The _E8110_ had a dual-core _Intel Core Duo T2400_ CPU (albeit 32-bit only, my first multi-core), 1 GB of RAM and a 40 GB HDD. Especially great was its 1400x1050 screen resolution. In times when 1280x720 was common this was way ahead.

At home it got joined by a _Fujitsu Esprimo E7935 E-Star 4_. This had an _Intel Core 2 Duo E8400_ and 4 GB of RAM. Below it can be seen with an _Thinkpad X200 with Libreboot_ on top.

The latter one was bought basically for the cause of trying and supporting _Libreboot_. Since the 32-bit CPU of the _E8110_ and its 1 GB of RAM were becoming more and more of an obstacle this tiny laptop was a great addition - only the 1280x720 screen hurt.

For my master thesis (bringing together parallel computing and supply chain optimization) I needed something with many cores. So for € 450,- I shot an old workstation on eBay with two _AMD Opteron 2419 EE_ CPUs from 2009 which gave me 12 cores.

In 2018 came a _TUXEDO Computers Infinity Book Pro 15 v4_. Equipped with an _Intel Core i5-8265U_ CPU and 16 GB of RAM it served well as a reasonably powerful but mobile rig for working on open source projects while commuting to my paid software development job. It once fell and the screen refused to work afterwards, but I thanks God could fix it ([link](https://markuspg.github.io/posts/clevo_n15xzu_teardown)).

The most recent addition is an _Intel Core i5-12600K_ on a [MSI PRO Z690-A WIFI](https://de.msi.com/Motherboard/PRO-Z690-A-WIFI) with 32 GB of RAM with _Coreboot_ from [3mdeb](https://3mdeb.com). Again this was to support open firmware and it serves well as general-purpose workhorse at home.

One particularly honourable mention is an _AMD 5200+_ from 2008. This computer served as my main office computer from about 2017, when I got it used for free, until a few weeks ago. In the end it was painfully slow and not even able to play Youtube videos properly, but it still did what it should do. But after recently running out of RAM when purchasing flight tickets and a little later the video output going black I decided to grant this box its well deserved retirement.

In my first paid full time position I had some _Fujitsu-Siemens_ laptop too, but I don't remember any specifics. Only that the series had issues with the touchpads and was hated by the sales guys for that, who always had to carry USB mice with them. At my second employer I had a _Dell Precision 5530_ laptop, which was absolutely great. 32 GB of RAM and an _Intel Core i7_. At my current job I have a _Dell Inspiron 16_ with an _Intel Core i7-12700H_. The CPU is definitely more powerful and great for running VHDL simulations, but the build quality is noticably cheaper than the "tank" _Precision 5530_.

In terms of screens for half of my life I had an _EIZO Flexscan F67_ 19 inch CRT monitor. This thing was great for its time, but bulky and using plenty of electricity. My loving parents bought it because they wanted me to damage my eyes as little as possible. In hindsight I slightly regret putting it to the trash, but in the advent of affordable big flatscreens and with a very crammed student room it had to go. It got replaced by another _EIZO_, an _EIZO FlexScan EV2416W_ which servers me faithfully to this day.

All in all this sums up to twelve computers, quite an impressive number. From the top of my head I would have guessed six or seven.
