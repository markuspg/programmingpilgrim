Unfortunately my _InfinityBook Pro 15 v4_ from [TUXEDO Computers GmbH](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com) recently got dropped badly twice. After the second drop the screen was flickering at best or not working at all. This made me attempt to disassemble it to try to fix the screen. The barebone is a _N15xZU_ from _Clevo_. The sticker on the underside can be seen below:

At first I loosened all screws on the underside. The red and the yellow one are particularly important, since these are required to lift the keyboard in the next step. Through the hole of the yellow screw the keyboard can be lifted slightly by pressing it with a thin stick.

Lifting the keyboard by pressing it from below allowed to go under it in its edges and then slowly unclip it all around. Special care has to be taken not to pluck out its cables forcefully! The brackets of the cables' sockets are to be carefully folded upwards. Mistakenly I thought they were to be pulled off in direction of the cables, but this broke the brackets off. Still the cables hold reasonably well, but it's better to avoid that.

Below the keyboard are some more screws that need to be unscrewed before the bottom shell can be taken off.

Now the mainboard is accessible, which in my case did not show any signs of damage - thanks God!

The logical conclusion was that the issue must be with the screen. Since the screen does not have any screws I started by carefully breaking it open along the edges and then all around. In this case special care has to be taken around the assembly of the camera to not damage it itself or its cables.

With the screen being broken open all around (does not sound and feel good, but it's still closing and holding acceptably) the culprit could be found. The plug to the screen came loose at the base of the screen itself. Unfortunately it's covered by some transparent glued cover. But still with some pointy device I could put enough force on the slipped out edge to push it back into place.

What's the result? The laptop feels quite flimsy now, but the screen works again :-)
